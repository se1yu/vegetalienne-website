            <h1> Our Restaurant </h1>
            <p> At Végétalienne, we pride ourselves on being a kitchen that specializes in dishes from the plant kingdom, particularly those inspired by vegan French cuisine. The word végétalienne means “vegan” in French. </p>
            <p> We ensure that every peel, from fruits and vegetables, becomes a component of a dish and does not go to waste. Every beverage served is derived from either vegan-friendly French drinks or Eastern beverages.</p>
            <p> Végétalienne’s ingredients are sourced from local farmers who prioritize organic and high-quality food provided by nature. The restaurant is located in the heart of New York City.</p>

            <h1> Chef Cara Byrne</h1>
            <p> After gaining eight years of experience as a chef in a Michelin-starred restaurant, Chef Cara Byrne sought to create her own kitchen. Despite not being vegan herself, she aimed to craft a “truly authentic” vegan kitchen inspired from French cuisine, breaking away from the familiar patterns of American vegan food. </p>
            <p> She says, “It’s always the salads or avocado toasts. What about the baked ratatouille or lemon mille-feuille?” Raised by maternal grandparents of French descent who cooked for her daily, she grew up well-versed in French cuisine. “No dish was foreign to me. The making of Végétalienne felt just about right.”</p>
            <p>“I wanted to create a vegan kitchen with a unique taste unlike much of American vegan culture. To my knowledge, being vegan is not just an act of love but a lifestyle. I wanted to pay an homage to that lifestyle and to my grandparents, who gave me the dream of becoming a chef,” Chef Byrne says.  </p>
