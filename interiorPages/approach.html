        <h2 style=" margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 20px;"> From the Farm to Our Table</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; margin-right: 7rem;"> Here at Végétalienne, we are a farm-to-table restaurant, meaning that the food we serve comes directly from a farm without passing through a store, market, or distributor. Through this concept, farm-to-table can be considered a form of agricultural sustainability, as it helps to preserve the environment and reduces carbon footprint associated with produce transportation. Everyone benefits from farm-to-table: our customers enjoy fresh, high-quality, and natural meals made from farm-provided ingredients; farmers reap the profits from their goods; and our restaurant proudly present these goods to our customers. Farm-to-table represents a direct relationship between a farm and a restaurant.</p>

                    <strong>Planning</strong>
                    <p>First, we decide which meals will go on our menu. From there, we acquire the necessary ingredients. Next, we verify that cooking utensils and equipment are functioning properly by organizing and sorting inventory.</p>

                    <p>Before using the ingredients, we wash and dry them. Then we cut, peel, slice, and mix (if needed) the ingredients. We measure and pre-weigh them for accuracy and consistency. Afterwards, we preheat equipment, assemble dishes, and store foods in their proper containers.</p>

                    <strong>Cooking</strong>
                    <p>We preheat cooking equipment to the correct temperature before use. We use a food thermometer to check the temperature of foods. Next, we add spices and seasonings, check for doneness, and, finally, plate the dishes.</p>

                    <strong>Cleaning & post-cooking</strong>
                    <p>After cooking, we preserve foods for later use. Then, we pre-sanitize and post-sanitize food contact surfaces, wash and sanitize utensils and equipment, dispose of food waste, and label food products.</p>
