    <h3 style=" margin-bottom: 50px;"> From the Farm to Our Table</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Here at Végétalienne, we are a farm-to-table restaurant, meaning that the food we serve comes directly from a farm without passing through a store, market, or distributor. Through this concept, farm-to-table can be considered a form of agricultural sustainability, as it helps to preserve the environment and reduces carbon footprint associated with produce transportation. Everyone benefits from farm-to-table: our customers enjoy fresh, high-quality, and natural meals made from farm-provided ingredients; farmers reap the profits from their goods; and our restaurant proudly present these goods to our customers. Farm-to-table represents a direct relationship between a farm and a restaurant.</p>
